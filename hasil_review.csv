0,Kota Lama Semarang,Gede Bagus Bayu Pentium,5.0,"It is a rising popular place in Semarang for both locals and tourists. The concept is the renewal of old building complexes from the colonial period. It has a lot of old buildings with colonial architecture. And then it's mixed with a lot of cafes, restaurants, photo spots, and places to chill. Unfortunately we went there during the day, it was quite hot and a lot of cars were going around. Our friend said during the night it would have a lot of light and very pretty. Especially on Saturday night it will have a car free night, so you can roam the area easily. I can imagine the place will be very nice if well lit during the night. Will try again to visit next time during night time."

8,Kota Lama Semarang,Rinaldi Suhardiono,5.0,One of the best area of culture and culinary destination in Semarang City. You can visit it during the day or night and still be amazed of the dutch architecture and history.

Lots of selfie and instagramable spot available and for your other social medias too.
9,Kota Lama Semarang,Ali Aulia Rahman,5.0,"A very well maintained old-town in Semarang! Unlike any other old-town like Kota Tua in Jakarta or Malioboro in Yogyakarta, Kota Lama in Semarang was way way way cleaner it seems like their governor taking care of its old town very serious.

10,Kota Lama Semarang,W NKS,3.0,"Our second visit to the place that once I loved most. Return during lunch time in a hope of stroll around admiring the old and neo classical architecture of the original site. Unfortunately things has changed, as much as we are glad to see business are thriving, there are few new ugly buildings that’s has nothing to do with the old charm of the city. Between the church and spiegel restaurant there is the ugliest building at the entire lot. Our driver told me it’s a hotel . Why even the city approved such a style to be seated there is beyond my belief."

To visit here, you can park in the front area of ​​Indomaret or in the jurnatan shopping area.

The service spirit is very good, friendly, and tries to answer every question well. The museum is cool because it uses multimedia (Audio Visual) to make it easier to understand the past history of the Old City of Semarang. Very cool.

Clean, nice, the design is not old like a museum in general, but the shape of the building is minimalist, the brick accents also make it homey and great for taking pictures. Here is a fairly clean pool and a glass bridge! They both make it beautiful. There are lots of stairs so each step is not so high (it makes you not tired and makes you great for taking pictures).
